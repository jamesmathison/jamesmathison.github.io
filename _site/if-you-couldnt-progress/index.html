    <p>Of just two skills Tim Ferriss claims are necessary for success, one of those is asking great questions.</p>

<p>The quote from Peter Thiel that Tim mentions above is laid out in more detail in <em>Tools of Titans</em>:</p>

<blockquote>If you go back 20 or 25 years, I wish I would have known that there was no need to wait…
So if you're planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can't you do this in 6 months? Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex, 10-year trajectory. But it's at least worth asking whether that's the story you're telling yourself, or whether that's the reality.</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>A good question is often specific to your situation.</p>

<p>For my situation this year, a good question is the following:</p>

<p><em>“What would I do if it was guaranteed that no matter what, I would make no progress at all in the next 6 months?”</em></p>

<p>That question works for me because I am very partial to grandiose fantasies of some big success that’s always just around the corner.</p>

<p>As I’ve grown older, the time frame has gradually lengthened, but not nearly enough. It takes time to do meaningful things, and my childish labrador-brain refuses to accept it. The “no progress” question forces me into a brief moment of maturity. It reminds me also to spend my time on things I will be happy to do for their own sake, not just as a means to an end.</p>

<p>The question probably <em>should</em> be
<em>“What would I do if I were guaranteed to make no progress at all this year?”</em></p>

<p>But I find that prospect just a little too terrifying to entertain…</p>
