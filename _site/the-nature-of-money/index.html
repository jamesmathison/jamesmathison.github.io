    <p>Dan Kennedy is a boss. A cynical, jaded boss, but a boss nonetheless.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOZRV6vw6xQ">part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imDqz6r0aZM">part 2</a> of his seminar <strong><em>The Source Code to Business Success and Advanced Wealth Attraction</em></strong>, he goes into what he sees is “the nature of money”.</p>

<p>It’s a heavy dose of wisdom.</p>

<p>Some may seem a little heartless, or at least lead to potentially heartless conclusions, but that’s what you get with a natural force.</p>

<p>And that was my biggest take-away.</p>

<p><strong>Money is a natural force.</strong></p>

<p>We don’t judge the wind because of what hurricanes can do. Yet we assign morality and judgementalism to virtually <em>anything</em> that involves money.</p>

<p>You’ll do much better to dettach your emotions from it, learn it’s nature, and then build some mother-fuckin windfarms! (Holla if you get the metaphor.)</p>

<h2 id="the-nature-of-money">The Nature of Money</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Money is entirely unresponsive to need
    <ul>
      <li>It doesn’t matter how much you need to pay the rent. Money never comes as a response to need.</li>
      <li>Makes me think of Ray Mears, talking about how fire is ironically hardest to create when you need it the most (alone in a cold, rainy woodland with the night closing in).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money ignores “pedigree”
    <ul>
      <li>Your credentials don’t mean jack.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money resents the attitude of entitlement
    <ul>
      <li>If you think you “deserve” money for any reason, money doesn’t want to flock to you.</li>
      <li>You might think you should have money because you’re a good person, or because you’re smart, or you work harder than anyone you know. Money doesn’t care.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money loves clarity
    <ul>
      <li>Personal clarity – who you are, what you’re doing here, what you will and won’t do for money, your values, what you and your time is worth.</li>
      <li>Forward orientation clarity - where the hell you’re going. Defined purpose. Clear goals. Stops you from being “day-to-day operator”. No growth = danger/contraction.</li>
      <li>Audience clarity. Market clarity.</li>
      <li>Message clarity. Benefits. Message to market match.</li>
      <li>Method clarity. E.g. Lots of customers don’t know they are supposed to create referals for you. “This is how it works around here.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money demands congruency - Has a highly tuned bullshit meter.
    <ul>
      <li>When you say you want something, DO things CONGRUENT with it.</li>
      <li>First thing to do is, you want X, you find someone who’s done X, and then you find any way you crawl up their butts.</li>
      <li>You might not know you’re incogruent. So think about it hard. Forget even unobvious actions, what would obviously be required?</li>
      <li>One way to be congruent with being wealthy, open up a wealth account and a giving account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money approves of intelligent generosity. It hates dumb giving (when you’re guilted into it).
    <ul>
      <li>Giving in other ways helps too, such as giving you time, advice, respect, appreciation, encouragement, or a spot on your platform or a helping hand through your influence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money likes organisers and organised environments.
    <ul>
      <li>Read: Devos’s autobiography. Distributors don’t get on the F400 list.</li>
      <li>No Disney execs are on that list, but the Disney family is.</li>
      <li>Get yourself out of being the participant and become an organiser.</li>
      <li>First thing you can organise is your workplace.</li>
      <li>Read: The Everything Store (book about Amazon)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Money expects you to take every aspect of your business VERY SERIOUSLY.
    <ul>
      <li>If you don’t, its bullshit detector goes off, says, “You’re not serious about what you’re trying to do.” and it goes away. Money thinks, “You don’t give a shit, why should I give a shit?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
