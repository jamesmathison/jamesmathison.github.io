  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>I’m listening to the MFCEO podcast, and they’re talking about the resistance people feel before making (and publishing) content.</p>

<p>I smiled to myself. I used to be that guy.</p>

<p>I’m past it, somehow. It’s worth clarifying how exactly.</p>

<h1 id="whats-different">What’s Different?</h1>

<p>It’s a different perspective. Another attitude. That’s it.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-i-come-across">The Way I Come Across</h2>

<p>The way I “come across” is no longer a highly valued aspect.</p>

<p>On the list of things that content production involves, it’s moved down the list. That’s all.</p>

<h2 id="good-enough">Good Enough</h2>

<p>Also, the barrier for “good enough” has changed.</p>

<p>I imagine if someone out there might get something good from it. A moment of reflection, a little smile, or an applicable idea.</p>

<h2 id="originality">Originality</h2>

<p>I have no shyness about using someone else’s content to give me fodder for my own. This article itself is a good example. I “steal” from others, and give them props for it. Anyone who didn’t know them is under no illusion that I’m being original, and now they know about the other person or business.</p>

<p>“Being original” in itself is also low on that list of content priorities.</p>

<p>Firstly, flat originality is impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s nothing new under the sun. 
– Ecclesiastes, the Bible.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.
– Oscar Wilde</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is an evolution from what came before.</p>

<p>Secondly, what does “being original” bring to the reader?</p>

<p>High on the list of priorities is giving them something good, remember. It’s the top priority, in fact.</p>

<p>Make them think, make them smile, or help them progress.</p>

<p>“Being original” does not do that.</p>

<h2 id="the-focus">The Focus</h2>

<p>The focus is on others.</p>

<p>I’m doing this for my own benefit, but that does not mean it helps to think about myself while I do it. I’m just not really an element of the content I produce. Once it’s out there, the only thing that exists is the interaction between the content and you, the reader.</p>

<p>I’m not there with you, so why do I matter?</p>

<p>This is the core of this shift. It’s liberating. It has made me <em>prolific</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe it could do the same for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t need permission. You don’t have to have someone say, “Oh yes, you’re good on video.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So many people…start off their content with a 20 second whine about how they’re not qualified to do it. Dude, nobody wants to hear that. That’s not content. Skip right to the meat.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It makes me as a viewer second-guess myself because I thought I wanted to watch you because you’re smart.</p>
</blockquote>
