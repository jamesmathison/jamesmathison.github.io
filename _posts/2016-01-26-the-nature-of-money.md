Dan Kennedy is a boss. A cynical, jaded boss, but a boss nonetheless. 

In [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOZRV6vw6xQ) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imDqz6r0aZM) of his seminar ***The Source Code to Business Success and Advanced Wealth Attraction***, he goes into what he sees is "the nature of money". 

It's a heavy dose of wisdom. 

Some may seem a little heartless, or at least lead to potentially heartless conclusions, but that's what you get with a natural force. 

And that was my biggest take-away. 

**Money is a natural force.**

We don't judge the wind because of what hurricanes can do. Yet we assign morality and judgementalism to virtually *anything* that involves money. 

You'll do much better to dettach your emotions from it, learn it's nature, and then build some mother-fuckin windfarms! (Holla if you get the metaphor.)

## The Nature of Money

1. Money is entirely unresponsive to need
- It doesn't matter how much you need to pay the rent. Money never comes as a response to need. 
- Makes me think of Ray Mears, talking about how fire is ironically hardest to create when you need it the most (alone in a cold, rainy woodland with the night closing in). 

2. Money ignores "pedigree"
- Your credentials don't mean jack. 

3. Money resents the attitude of entitlement
- If you think you "deserve" money for any reason, money doesn't want to flock to you. 
- You might think you should have money because you're a good person, or because you're smart, or you work harder than anyone you know. Money doesn't care. 

4. Money loves clarity 
- Personal clarity – who you are, what you're doing here, what you will and won't do for money, your values, what you and your time is worth. 
- Forward orientation clarity - where the hell you're going. Defined purpose. Clear goals. Stops you from being "day-to-day operator". No growth = danger/contraction.
- Audience clarity. Market clarity.
- Message clarity. Benefits. Message to market match. 
- Method clarity. E.g. Lots of customers don't know they are supposed to create referals for you. "This is how it works around here." 

5. Money demands congruency - Has a highly tuned bullshit meter.
- When you say you want something, DO things CONGRUENT with it.
- First thing to do is, you want X, you find someone who's done X, and then you find any way you crawl up their butts. 
- You might not know you're incogruent. So think about it hard. Forget even unobvious actions, what would obviously be required? 
- One way to be congruent with being wealthy, open up a wealth account and a giving account. 

6. Money approves of intelligent generosity. It hates dumb giving (when you're guilted into it). 
- Giving in other ways helps too, such as giving you time, advice, respect, appreciation, encouragement, or a spot on your platform or a helping hand through your influence. 

7. Money likes organisers and organised environments. 
- Read: Devos's autobiography. Distributors don't get on the F400 list. 
- No Disney execs are on that list, but the Disney family is. 
- Get yourself out of being the participant and become an organiser. 
- First thing you can organise is your workplace. 
- Read: The Everything Store (book about Amazon)

8. Money expects you to take every aspect of your business VERY SERIOUSLY. 
- If you don't, its bullshit detector goes off, says, "You're not serious about what you're trying to do." and it goes away. Money thinks, "You don't give a shit, why should I give a shit?"
