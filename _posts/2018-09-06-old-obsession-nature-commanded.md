What's better: to complain about your wage, or understand the nature of money with the mind to create a strategy for increasing it?

What's better: to call women "bitches", men "assholes"… or learn the nature of courtship and attraction? 

What's better: to beat yourself up for not changing, or try to understand the nature of your own mind?

…

I once became obsessed with methods of living with nature instead of forcing it to conform to our standards. I started with food, after watching a BBC documentary *Farm for the Future*. I saw how 10 years of intense farming destroys the natural fertility of the soil ([Click here for the scene I'm talking about](https://youtu.be/lme1R7gQMe8?t=94)).

Working against nature, barren farms soon have to buy artificial fertilisers and pesticides, putting their farm on life-support for one more year… indentured consumers for "big-agri" companies. 

But what's the solution?

We can't go back to horse-ploughs. It takes too much manpower, and the farming population plummeted from 22% of the total population (in the UK) in 1841, down to 1% now. 

We're not going to convince 1/5th of modern folk to start ploughing.

Seemed hopeless.

Then…people looked deeper into the nature of food. 

Turns out, if you are sensitive to Nature's needs, she'll do a lot for you, and your food will be far tastier and far more nutritious as a consequence. 

**You can:**

- [Raise happy geese with fat, delicious livers](https://youtu.be/gvrgD0mAFoU) (for fancy foie gras), without having to force-feed them. 
- [Turn deserts green again](https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI) by shepherding massive herds of grazers over them! (Wtf?!)
- [Farm fish in an almost self-raising environment](https://youtu.be/4EUAMe2ixCI). Apparently, the fish taste as good as wild, because they essentially are. 
- [Grow oranges (among many other things) at alpine altitudes](https://youtu.be/Bw7mQZHfFVE) by creating terraced pools of water each with a large red rock in the middle, heated by the sun and creating a warm micro-climate. 

That's just for starters. 

Then I learned someone had developed a type of building that generated your electricity, treated your water, grew your food, and managed your sewage. **You could live 100% off-grid in luxury** with what he named "[Earthships](https://youtu.be/TlntQ9EgOxg)".


## My Lost Motivation

All of the above are mind-boggling achievements done by working with Nature and not against her. 

I wanted to travel the world, document all these things, and find a way to contribute. 

To fund these travels, I decided to learn how to make money online. I turned to freelance writing. 

I tried to learn the Nature of money, but it wasn't enough.

I've never stopped struggling, and not for a lack of skill or even bravery. I simply could not stop self-sabotaging. 

I did not understand enough *the Nature of myself*.

I'll leave it there for now. [Tomorrow](/demons-fairies-failure) I'll summarise my misadventures in personal development and spirituality. I was blind to the "clog" in my psyche that compelled me to keep miss-firing, but that certainly didn't stop me from trying!

Peace!
