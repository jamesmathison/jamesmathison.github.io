Patreon is Kickstarter for on-going work.

Just as artists of old used to have "patrons", (rich folk who would keep their favourite ones fed so they could focus on their work), Patreon is a modern crowd-funding alternative.

It makes me think of [Angel.co](https://angel.co/invest), a platform that lets you invest (relatively) small amounts in startups. Meaning you no longer need to be a gajillionaire to be an angel investor. 

Could Patreon be the answer to the problem plagueing artists to this day… maintaining a stable income? 

<!-- more -->

I've seen articles teaching artists [how to sell their work online](http://theabundantartist.com/how-to-write-art-sales-page/) before, but how many of them really want to take time away from their craft? And how many more have *massive emotional resistance* to the idea, because they feel marketing is "sleazy"? 

This platform allows them to focus on their art. Just like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) allows online course creators to focus on theirs. 

Patreon's a young company. Only 2 years old. I'll keep my eye on it. 

Meanwhile, do you feel your excuses to pursue your artistic passions diminishing month by month?
