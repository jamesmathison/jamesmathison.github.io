Norm Macdonald is a legend.

He is one of a handful of comedians left who is not bowing to mounting pressure to be politically correct. The beauty of Norm, too, is that he seems so loveable and huggable that he can get away with more than most [strait white] men can in today's climate. 

Apparently, though, he went "too far" recently when he said to The Hollywood Reporter:

> I'm happy the MeToo movement has slowed down a bit. It used to be, "One hundred women can't be lying." And then it became, "One woman can't lie." And that became, "I believe all women." And then you're like, "What?"

For that, he was cancelled from The Tonight Show and he was promptly [Twitter-mobbed](https://youtu.be/INj2Dw5f710?t=154) and shamed for his opinion.

Steven Crowder goes through a bit of Norm's history of "standing up to power" as he put it. He makes the case that if Norm is successfully silenced in this case, more may be at stake than just his career. Norm is such a bastion of refreshing bluntness that if he bows to accusations of "wrong-think*, the ripple effect might touch freedom of speech itself. 

Alarmist? Maybe, butÂ #ImWithNorm, (and I always have been).
