Remember the Three Aspects of Good Headlines:
1. Self-interest
2. News
3. Curiosity

Notice how each one focuses on the reader:
1. Something beneficial
2. Something novel
3. Something intriguing 

*"Make it worth your reader's while to read your ad"* is the most basic copywriting rule, and yet so many still fail to put it into practice. 

In *Tested Advertising Methods* (a must-read book for you if you want to [become a master copywriter](http://www.jamesmathison.co.uk/the-self-made-copywriter-intensive/)), John Caples makes a beautiful illustration of what happens when a copywriter misses this fundamental tenet. 

The following lists compare two types of headlines.

List 1 was written by general advertisers who cannot track the effectiveness of individual ads.

List 2 was written by mail order copywriters who live and die by the *demonstrable* effectiveness of each thing they write. 

*(These headlines were written a very long time ago, so make allowances for the old-fashioned wording.)*

&nbsp;

## List 1: Headlines from General Advertisers 
**Notice:** They're often trying to be clever, and the result is a confusing headline that doesn't explain the offer. 

* YOUR LUNCHEON ON MANY A SUMMER'S DAY!
* WHAT'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD WHEN GIRLS JUST WILL BE BOYS?
* THIS NOSE BELONGS TO A THRIFTY WOMAN
* BLANK'S CANDY––THE FIFTH THAT MAKES THE FOURSOME
* LUCKY BABY
* FIRST YOU LISTEN! THEN JUST DIP IN YOUR SPOON
* IT WON'T GO OFF!

&nbsp;

## List 2: Headlines from Direct Marketers
**Notice:** Little cleverness. Little "flair". Simply direct, clear, understandable offers. 

* BE A HOTEL HOSTESS
* BANISH TEETERING FURNITURE
* LIFETIME FLOOR COATING
* SPARE-TIME CASH
* KILL ANT COLONIES AT THEIR SOURCE
* SPRAY YOUR WEEDS AWAY WITH WEED OUT
* MATERNITY FROCKS
* START A $10,000 LIFE INSURANCE POLICY FOR $1
* HOLLYWOOD'S MAKE-UP SECRET
