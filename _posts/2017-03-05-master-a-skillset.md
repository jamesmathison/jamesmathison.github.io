The BEST advice to beginning entrepreneurs.

Master a skillset. 

Seems obvious to some, but others will read that and think, "I don't have time for that (despite being 22)." or, "But you should start with automation/scalability/independence as the goal, right?" 

I used to be that kid. 

The fastest way to get to where you really want to go (a successful and fulfilling career), is to *master* something. 

It The MFCEO podcast 126, Mike Dillard seriously [breaks it down](http://pca.st/3jwF#t=3748):

> "[Mastering a skillset] is the key to everything. If you master a skillset, it empowers you to take action and to get a result and to create momentum in you life. It turns you into a source of value for other individuals."

He goes on to implore: Figure out how your brain is wired. 

If you're an analytical, numbers-based person, master Facebook advertising. 

If you're a more creative type, master copywriting. 

Mike is an introverted creative type himself - a type that most would probably say makes a better artist than entrepreneur. He is living proof that self-awareness allows you to manoeuvre around any built-in "limitations". He hated selling in person, so he learned how to sell with the written word. 

Entrepreneurship seems to be one of the most personality-agnostic career paths out there. 

No matter who or what you are, just figure out how to make it work.

And master a valuable skillset that falls in line with that.
