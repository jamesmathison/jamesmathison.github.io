Exerpts from an interesting online-book project. [Read it here](http://www.changecollective.com/humans-this-is-how-behavior-change-works/).

>Instead of thinking about any new lifestyle change as a giant project, first approach it as an experiment to decide whether it works for you. Look at your situation. Figure out a good first step. Try it out. Then repeat.

>In our own lives and in the lives of thousands of course-takers at Change, this approach has consistently delivered results. It has worked well in spite of, or perhaps due to, not being tied to a single behavior change model. Itâ€™s been so successful that we rethought our product, and indeed our entire approach to behavior change.
