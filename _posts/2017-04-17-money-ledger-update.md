On the 30th of March [I made a commitment to keep a money ledger](http://www.jamesmathison.co.uk/money-measurement), and in doing so, keep a constant eye on my finances – to know *all* my numbers. 

It’s something a lot of us struggle with. We avoid looking at our finances. Maybe we find it depressing, or just boring. Whatever the case, not being sure about your current, past, and future finances sets you back in the money game. [It would be like an athlete not measuring her performance stats](http://www.jamesmathison.co.uk/money-or-service/). 

I’ve prepared [a template of my money ledger](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A26M6eHWrcnwdlbbDbh70LyBSECUi6P-83MLGhqwv78/) in Google Sheets. Copy it to your own Drive if you like. Your columns will of course be unique to your financial structure. 

You'll notice the first three column after "Total" are comparisons. This makes it a snap to see how far you've come (or, heaven forbid, fallen) compared to the same day last week, last month, and last quarter. 

This is my first quarter keeping a ledger like this, so the comparison to last quarter is blank for now. I'll start a separate sheet for quarter 3 when July roles around. 

## Future Finances
Each morning, I've taken my total for the day, and manually compared it to my goal for the quarter, and make a note of the difference (£X to go). It's important to then remind yourself where your known sources of income are, and how much of that figure they constitute. The remaining number (the money that'll have to come from some currently-unknown source) will be the focus of your planning. 

## What's Changed
(Almost) Every time I've filled in this money ledger, I've spent some time beforehand letting go of limiting beliefs and negative feelings about money. The combination has practically eliminated all resistance to keeping such close track of my money. 

I still feel a lack of enthusiasm from time to time, but the compulsion to avoid it, the guilt/shame/anger about where I currently stand, has diminished tremendously. 

## There's More
An athlete tracks much more than miles run or shots taken. 

If you want to play the money game well, you'll need to track much more than Total Cash Assets, and even more than future goal and known/unknown sources. 

There's also the number of clients or customers you'll need to close per month. There's average acquisition cost. There's the exact price, scope, and costs of your service(s), and the contracts you should have ready to go before spending your time on a project. 

The **clearer** you are, the more money you'll attract, according to Dan Kennedy. 

The video where Dan covers the "character traits of money" has sadly been taken down, but the breakdown is this:

1. Money is unresponsive to need. 
2. Money ignores pedigree. 
3. Money resents the attitude of entitlement. 
4. **Money loves clarity.**
5. **Money demands congruency.**
6. Money approves of intelligent generosity. 
7. **Money likes organisers, and organised environments.**
8. **Money expects you to take every aspect of your business very seriously.**

I've highlighted the points that are hit by being ultra-clear about all your numbers. 

There's no rational reason not to get as clear as humanly possible on your money. The only reasons that I can see are emotional. And [emotions can be dealt with easily](http://www.jamesmathison.co.uk/feelings-can-be-dealt-with).
