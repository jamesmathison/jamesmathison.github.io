The Fizzle Show sent out <a href="https://fizzle.co/sparkline/become-successful-seriously-fs198">a great episode</a> this week. It's a foundational show, asking the question – How do you <em>actually</em> be successful?

Chase sums up an effortlessly profound mental shift at the 44-minute mark:
<blockquote>"Be like Ira Glass. Choose to pursue being great at something, instead of just being great."</blockquote>
We often fall into the trap of trying to "be great" somehow. Take yourself out of the equation, and the path to greatness becomes a lot simpler and a lot more reachable.

Become great at something. Bonus points if it's something you love.
