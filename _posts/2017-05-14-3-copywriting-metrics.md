Copywriters make more money over time if they know what the most important metrics are, and how they work together. 

The Fizzle show's recent episode, [CEO-ing Your Business: The 3 Metrics that Matter (FS212)](https://fizzle.co/sparkline/ceoing-your-business), got me thinking about what the most important metrics are for a copywriter, following the same framework. 

The framework for Fizzle's top 3 metrics was a funnel, with **Reach** at the top, **Sign Ups** in the middle, and **Lifetime Value** at the bottom. 

&nbsp;

## 1. Reach
**Using Reach out of context:** Clickbait…super-enticing headlines (& images) that disappoint because the content behind them doesn't deliver.

**Using Reach well:** Qualified Leads. First-contact copy weeds out the people who would not be valuable to the business anyway, and still pulls good numbers. 

Copywriters are not so concerned with traffic, but our work has a lot to do with reach. A Facebook ad that is so unappealing that no-one clicks has no "true" reach, no matter how many people have it pop up on their screens. If they ignore it, you haven't really "reached" them. 

**Reach**, for a copywriter, is the number of people who read your *key* page. This means they have just clicked an ad, a social post, or a headline, which are all examples of *tippy-top-level* copy. 

You'll need the other metrics to determine if your "reaching copy" is pulling in qualified leads or dead-end viewers.

## 2. Conversions (Sign Ups)
**Using Conversions out of context:** "Salesiness"… short term sales tactics that coerce or pressure people to convert, but that gives them *big* "buyer's remorse". 

**Using Conversions well:** Qualified (Happy) Customers. Communicate the product's value, address objections, and give people what their "logical" brain needs to justify doing what the "emotional" brain wants – buy. 

Short-term thinking leads to short-term businesses. If you use every "dirty" trick in the book, you *will* get more sales *today*, but the next level – stickiness – will suffer. There are many brands I will never buy from again because I feel even a *little bit* used or manipulated. A business operating that way *can* still work, but they have to work that much harder for every sale as they continue into the future. 

&nbsp;

## 3. Stickiness (Lifetime Value)
**Using Stickiness out of context:** Empty Pipeline. If you forget about the first two levels and focus only on customer retention, your "sales pipeline" will run dry, and you'll find yourself in a tricky position. 

**Using Stickiness well:** Exponential Momentum. 

By watching and improving Reach and Conversions *in context*, Stickiness becomes the final touch that turns a project into a thriving business. 

If people you "reached" were delighted by what they found behind your headline, and people you "converted" felt *invited* and never deceived, the people who "stick" will become your new sales force. 

Copy that *nurtures* existing customers and occasionally sells them new awesome things is the copy that belongs to the bottom of the funnel, and it has the potential to turn ever customer into 3, 5, 10 more customers over time, and every sale into 3, 5, 10 more sales.
