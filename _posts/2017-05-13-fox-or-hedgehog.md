In the 600s BC, poet Archilochus  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archilochus" target="_blank">wrote</a>:

> "Πόλλ᾽ οἶδ᾽ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ' ἐχῖνος ἕν μέγα." (The fox knows many things; the hedgehog one big thing.)

In <a href="http://www.tropicalmba.com/knotel/" target="_blank">TMBA385: To Headquarter or Not to Headquarter?</a>, interviewee Amol Sarva <a href="http://pca.st/5IGv#t=348" target="_blank">said</a>: 

> "My way of organising the world is there are some people who are foxes and some people who are hedgehogs. 
>
>"Hedgehogs, by inclination, are the type of personality that have one big thing. My own mindset and personality fits into this other category – the fox. 
>
>"The fox is someone who knows many things, moves easily between these many different topics, maybe doesn't end up spending huge amounts of time deep inside one domain, and therefore is somebody that's making connections or finding insights from one place to another and cross pollinating."

It sounds like he's exhorting the fox type, but later he mentions how his "foxy" personality got in the way of his success in the past. A big part of his current success is due to recognising the shortcomings of a fox, and looking for hedgehogs to join him.

> "…[Knotel] feeds my fox-like personality, **but I can't be the hedgehog that the business needs**. 
>
>"One of the first moves I made when I got started was recruiting folks that I thought could be extraordinarily focused, powerful, diligent, hedgehog-style leaders for the company. 
>
>"That's a mistake in the past I've made, I thought I could do it in my own personality, and this time I've tried to assemble a much more mixed, much more diverse, different-skill-type team, and this fox/hedgehog thing is right at the core of it."

**I've got a lot of time for anyone this self-aware.**

## Blending
I identify as a fox – definitely. 

However, like Amol, it's held me back. 

A fox scavenges around the surface, while hedgehogs are picking a spot and digging down, making a rich network of underground burrows. 

But foxes make burrows, too. 

And hedgehogs do occasionally come up to the surface. 

Hedgehog people must remember to remain open to new ideas and to change, because that's not what they do naturally. 

Fox people must remember to go deep when they find something worthwhile, or else they'll happily spend their whole life scavenging for something better. 

## Copywriting for Foxes
I've found a way to go deep into **the most financially-valuable skill on the planet**, while still leaving most of the day open for all the playful foxiness I like. 

The skill is copywriting, and arguably the best copywriter of the 20th century (Gary Halbert) left us with a proven, reliable method for mastery. 

The method is not easy…but it is simple…and it works. 

I'm about to gather a group of people to walk this path together for the next 12 weeks. We'll hold each other accountable to the **one daily habit** that has already produced the *wealthiest* copywriters the world has ever seen. 

I'm calling it [The Self-Made Copywriter Intensive](http://www.jamesmathison.co.uk/the-self-made-copywriter-intensive). 

I invite you to join me.
