This morning I put up a website, and I'm now The [Cracow Copywriter](http://www.cracowcopywriter.com). 

What does that mean?

In a nutshell: *I provide native-English copywriting to small businesses and startups based in Cracow, Poland.*

That's what they call a **micro-niche**.

I've lived in the gorgeous city of Cracow for more than a year now, and it turned out to be accidental genius. I'm only able to capitalise on that move now that I'm finally aware of why it was such a good idea. 

I put myself in a place where: 

1. demand exceeded supply for my services, and
2. the market is growing. 

Over the last year of living here, I don't think I've met one single other "native English copywriter". I'm *certainly* the only one knocking around the coworking space where I like to work from ([hub:raum](https://www.hubraum.com/locations/krakow)). There are a handful of native English business consultants here who write great copy, but they're not offering it to the market as a stand-alone service. 

Part of why we are so low on the ground might be because pay is low. People are often surprised I'm even here when I was born in London, but it's not smart to optimise for income when you're in your twenties. It's a much better idea to capitalise for education and options. 

And I'm getting a fantastic education here, and I *could* have more options than I know what to do with, if I work on positioning myself. That's what I'm doing now.

I would struggle, with my current track record and network, to make a real name for myself in London. 

Here, though, I've developed a small reputation without even trying. 

But why would I try? Why be a big fish in a small pond? 

Firstly, this pond is growing. As wages rise to meed the country's amazing production, and startups keep springing up at the pace of the last decade, Poland will see more and more young copywriters come here to fill this gap. 

And I'll already be there. 

Secondly, you can take a track record with you wherever you go next. 

Just because I'm the "Cracow Copywriter" now, doesn't mean I'm pigeon-holed. It just means I'm FAR more appealing to a specific group of buyers. And that will give my tires the traction they need to give me some altitude.

Matthew Hussey used to be a dating coach, and worried about being locked in to that definition forever. 

He was wrong. 

Success in any venture can be transferred into success in the next.

##Hyperfocused marketing can lead to broad business opportunities. 

That's the hook of [the TMBA podcast episode #201 with John McIntyre](http://www.tropicalmba.com/focused-marketing-business-opportunities/). 

I listened to it *ages ago*, and never really implemented it. 

At 9:39, John starts talking about **occupying a slot in people's brains**. 

>"If you can occupy a slot in their brain, which is much easier to do when you're niched down as The Autoresponder Guy or The Podcast Guy or a specific type of guy, they'll remember you, they'll recommend you, they'll go to you for that stuff."

I found a cool domain, www.theDirectMarketer.com, and wanted it as a personal brand name. It could strike associations with direct response marketing, and link easily with my ethical stance that marketing should be honest and true. 

But that ain't hyper-focused. 

Maybe it would be a good brand name for someone who wants to be a thought leader, but I have no business shooting for thought leadership right now. I've still got a decade or so of cutting my teeth. What an initial "brand" needs to do, if you want rapid growth, is to monopolise on a micro-niche. 

Get success in a narrow thing, get some altitude and then side-step if you want. 

##Becoming a Key Person of Influence

[Key Person of Influence](http://www.keypersonofinfluence.com/) is a book that comes HIGHLY recommended (though I haven't read it yet myself). 

A conversation I had about it with some fellow expats two days ago was what finally catalysed my decision to narrow down and hyper-focus on this market I'm in. 

The takehome message is that it's *far* easier to become influencial in a micro-niche than in a broad one. 

An example in the book is a six-figure baller who's business is teaching millionaires how to drive their boats. 

I don't know if my goal is to be "influential" per-se. I'm deliberately focusing only on a single income goal for the first quarter this year. 

However, becoming known as the go-to English copywriter in Cracow is going to help me raise my rates, and if I want to go into some sort of "influence" role later, this move will also put me in a position to do that. 

&nbsp;

I'll post more about the specific strategy I'll use as I develop it.
