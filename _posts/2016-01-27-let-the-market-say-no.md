I have a pretty common fear that I think a lot of you also have. 

I don't want to suggest a price, and be told, "No."

I made this same mistake EARLIER TODAY. 

This afternoon I was in a meeting with a company working in advertising on smart TV apps. A space that's extremely new right now. The guy asked me for a price. 

I'm pretty busy. I have options. And yet, I decided to give him a price I thought he would be very happy with. 

"Nice guy" syndrome…bigtime. <!-- futurelink - to book review of No More Mr Nice Guy -->

Later, at home, I watched a Gary Vaynerchuk video where he stared me in the face and told me what I should have done. 

"Let the market say no."

Here's the clip.

It reminded me of an interview Chase Jarvis had with Ramit Sethi where he describes how his first photography negotation went. He went in knowing he was pricing high, and fully expected to get resistance. And his prospect said yes right away. 

Chase was *pissed*. He could have asked for more. 

Here's the clip.

The mindsets of these men is one that I (…that all of us…) *must* adopt if we hope to earn good money, whether as freelancers or as entrepreneurs. 

You need to be *pissed* if the other guy says yes too fast. 

I'm playing with ideas about how to remedy this in my own brain. 

Perhaps I should go all "Psycho-Cybernetics" on it, spending 10 minutes every morning imagining similar scenarios, visualising every detail in vivid reality, and rehearse asking for more money than the other can afford, and *enjoying* having them have to come down to a lower price. 

It's not about being a douche about it, as Chase said. 

It's just a fact that if you've been pitching services for a while **and you haven't heard a "no" after quoting your price**, you're leaving wads of cash on the table that are yours for the claiming.
