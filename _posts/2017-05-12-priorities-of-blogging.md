What you write is more important than how you write it. 

Who reads your writing is more important than how many. 

What it means is more important than how it sounds.

Consistency is more important than quality. 

What it does for others is more important than what it does for you. 

Your email list is more important than you blog archive. 

Hypocrisy is not so bad. 

I'll freely admit that I need improvement on *all* the above, and have no right to be preaching about any of them. Oh well. This post is simply a reminder to myself, and maybe to you too, of what is important in writing. 

The most important thing is to ask yourself the following: **"Could this piece do something good for someone?"**

If yes, publish.
