Yesterday was The King, the central, organising archetype of the masculine psyche. 

Today is The Warrior, the leading edge of your realm. 

Your Warrior ought to take his place at the "edge" of your mind, so to say. His job is to expand into and conquer, in your own modern way, the world around you.

> "Around the planet, warfare in our century has reached such monstrous and pervasive proportions that aggressive energy itself is looked upon with deep suspicion and fear. This is the age in the West of the "soft masculine,"…"

The Warrior *is* destructive. There are many things in this world that need destroying. There are many things in your life that need conquering. As a man with a masculine core, you cannot be all-nurturing, all-merciful, all-compromise. If you are, you're likely to feel that something is sorely missing from how you meet the world.

### Skill

### Detachment 
> "…the Warrior should not be identified with human rage in any simple way – quite the opposite.…"

The Warrior is emotionally detached. "Unavailable". He requires the other archetypes to balance him, such as the Lover for emotional connection and empathy.  

The Warrior's job is not to empathise. The Warrior's job is to get the job done, no matter what. 

However, this also means he never acts out of anger. 

> "There is a story about a samurai attached to the household of a great lord. His lord had been murdered by a man from a rival house, and the samurai was sworn to avenge his lard'- death. After tracking the assassin for some time, after great personal sacrifice and hardship, and after braving many dangers, the samurai found the murderer. He drew his sword to kill the man. But in that instant the assassin spat in his face. The samurai stepped back, sheathed his sword, and turned and walked away. Why? 
>  
> "He walked away because he was angry that he'd been spat on. He would have killed the assassin, in that moment, out of his own personal anger, not out of his commitment to the ideal his lord represented."

### Commitment
The Warrior requires the King to give him direction, a higher cause. 

The Warrior is a force of aggressive power. His skill and determination is focused to a sharp point, like the edge of a spear, to penetrate his opponent. 

An "orphaned" Warrior is a hair's breadth from his Shadow, because he *must* have a purpose. If he isn't committed to anything bigger than himself, then the Ego will gladly take that role.

## Active Shadow: The Sadist

The Shadow Warrior has done more damage to one aspect of masculinity that gives the whole gender of men a bad name. 

When the Warrior begins to fight for his own gain, or out of anger or pride, The Sadist emerges. 

In highly stressful circumstances, we might be overcome with "bloodlust" – a kind of automatic cruelty or savagery. The cool detachment and discernment of the full Warrior is nowhere to be seen, and unchecked destruction rages, like a fire that have got out of control. 

&nbsp;

## Passive Shadow: The Masochist

The placid pushover that lives just beneath the Sadist's rageful displays. 

> "The Masochist projects Warrior energy onto others and causes a man to experience himself as powerless. The man possessed by the Masochist is unable to defend himself psychologically, he allows others (and himself) to push him around, to exceed the limits of what he can tolerate and still keep his self-respect…"

## Accessing The Warrior
If you're accessing your inner Warrior appropriately, you'll experience energy, decisiveness, and courage. You'll see through bullshit and understand what needs to be done, and find the resolve to do it. You'll find your "hardness". You'll find yourself able to "attack" for the greater good, such as making a friend or a loved one feel bad about something they did when they really *should* feel bad about it, either for their own good or for another's. You'll set boundaries and see that people keep to them. 

Without any of the other archetypes, you'd by a rigid asshole. But then, that's why we have the others. :)
