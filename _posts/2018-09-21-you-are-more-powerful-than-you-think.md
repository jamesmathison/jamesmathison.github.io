Here's the first verse of Akira the Don's *"More Powerful Than You Think"*, a lofi mix of Jordan Peterson. 

When I listen to it, it's like medicine. 

> I was trying to solve this terrible puzzle about how it was that human beings got themselves in such a tangle about what they believed. Such a tangle that we were pointing the ultimate weapons of destruction at one another. Which, by the way, we are still doing. 
> 
> I thought okay, I understand that. We need our belief systems. They orient us. And that means there will be conflict between belief systems and that can be a catastrophe and that's been played out everywhere, again, in very many ways. 
> 
> What's the solution to that?
> 
> One possibility is there's no solution. It's just mayhem all the way around. Could be the case. But it seemed, to me, as I delved into it that the proper solution to that was to live properly as an individual. 
> 
> **You're more powerful than you think.**
> 
> **Way more powerful.** 
> 
> **God only knows what you are in the final analysis.**
