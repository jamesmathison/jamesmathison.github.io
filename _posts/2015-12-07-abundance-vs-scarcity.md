How the majority of the world (and probably you) thinks, why it hurts them (you), and what they (you) can do about it. 

<a href=:"http://illimitablemen.com/2014/03/30/mental-models-abundance-vs-scarcity/">Click here to go to the original article</a>. 

It's a dense disection of the nature of how the majority of the world think. 

**It digs up and lays bare the vicious circle of comparing yourself with people above you:**

>Whilst a middle class individual compares themselves to a millionaire, a millionaire compares himself to a multi-millionaire and a multi-millionaire compares himself to a billionaire. Who does a billionaire compare himself to? A god, a mega celebrity or an esteemed historical figure. There is an insatiable appetite for glory manifesting as scarcity among most of humanity, even among the wealthy.

(Read more about [how to stop comparing yourself to others here](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/compare-less/))

**It touches on Shawn Anchor's point in [yesterday's post](http://www.thedirectmarketer.com/right-does-not-equal-happy/) about the advantage of positivity:**

>Negativity is synonymous with powerlessness and powerlessness is the ultimate form of scarcity.

<!-- more -->

**However, the solution is posits for becoming a positive, abundant type person is not totally satisfying to me:**

>There should be no room for men and women in your life who don’t contribute value to you. Be ruthless with your selectivity, success is of more paramountcy than popularity.

It's popular to say that you should surround yourself with positive people. "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with," as Jim Rohn said.

You can't argue with it. You certainly *should* surround yourself with great people, as much as you can. But I don't like the sociapathic mindset it leads to. 

**You can't pick and choose the characteristics of everyone you know like they're a Mii.**

And as this article admits…

>Negative energy is everywhere which is why a positively charged person is a beacon of light in a sea of darkness…

So you cannot be dependent on those around you to make you positive all the time, or you'll have to be a real Nazi about who you associate with. 

There are other ways to shift your default state towards a happier (more abundant) mode. 

Take [Shawn Achor](http://www.thedirectmarketer.com/right-does-not-equal-happy/) again, and the suggestions he makes in his happiness course:

- 3 Gratitudes
- Journaling (about at least one positive experience that day)
- Exercise
- Meditation 
- Random Acts of Kindness

Make a daily habit out of all of these things, and you will start becoming a **beacon**.
