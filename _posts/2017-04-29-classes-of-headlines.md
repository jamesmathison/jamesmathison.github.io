*Testing Advertising Methods* by John Caples is one of 9 books of essential reading for any copywriter (as claimed by Gary Halbert). 

I'm halfway through it, and I agree. It's gold.

In it, John spends a lot of time on headlines. He introduces them at Chapter 2: *The Most Important Part of an Advertisement*.

To make a good headline, start by understanding the three elements that constantly crop up in those that succeed:
1. Self-interest
2. News
3. Curiosity

*(In order from most important to least.)*

In fact, beware of using pure-curiosity headlines. If you do, ensure the *benefit* is clear in some other way, such as the image or the company logo/slogan.

All things being equal, self-interest beats curiosity.

Curiosity: **HERE'S ONE QUESTION YOU SHOULDN'T ASK YOUR WIFE** [ABC Life Insurance Company]

Self-Interest: **YOU CAN LAUGH AT MONEY WORRIES IF YOU FOLLOW THIS SIMPLE PLAN** [ABC Life Insurance Company]

&nbsp;

## Combine For Added Pulling-Power
Of course, though self-interest beats curiosity, a self-interest headline that *also* stimulates a little curiosity could do even better. 

Self-Interest: **HOW I BECAME A STAR SALESMAN**

Self-Interest + Curiosity: **HOW A FOOLISH STUNT MADE ME A STAR SALESMAN**

Now, combine News as well to make a kamakazi of appeal: 

Self-Interest + Curiosity + News: **REVEALED: THE HIDDEN, IDIOTIC MOVE THAT MADE ME A STAR SALESMAN IN A WEEK**

This last headline is not from the book. It's my own, untested, in-the-moment idea. As such it might fall flat, but probably only on **believability** issues. That can be fixed by softening the language. If only I had a product to test this headline onâ€¦

I'm enjoying this book. Gary's whole reading list is sizeable, considering the thickness of the books, but I would agree with him. All copywriters (and all entrepreneurs) would be greatly better off having read them all several times over.
