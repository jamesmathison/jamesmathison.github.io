I agree. 

In 1st Quarter 2016, I'm focusing as fully as I can on an income goal. This means I'm deliberately exerting no willpower whatsoever to stop myself from eating whatever I want.

But I AM going to try to develop a food-routine that gets me all my recommended daily nutrients with only whole food. 

That's going to take a big pile of veggies. 

If I have room left over, I can go to KFC, guilt-free. 

I believe that's going to go a hell of a lot better for me in the long-run than trying to cut stuff out. 

In your career, change is also more likely to happen by *positive* action (adding something) than *negative* action (taking something away). 

i.e. Be *more communicative* with clients by sending more comments to them per week, as opposed to trying to cut down on the amount of frivolous comments you leave on Facebook.
